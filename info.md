Cars that run on petrol release greenhouse gases that cause climate change.
One solution to this problem has been to gradually stop using petrol-powered
vehicles in favour of ones that run on electricity. But will this switch to electric
cars help us solve climate change?


Electric Vehicles
Have you ever noticed the ‘smoke’ that comes out of the back of a car? Well
this smoke is actually known as exhaust and it is produced when the car’s
engine burns petrol or diesel. Exhaust contains greenhouse gases, which
contribute to climate change.

Battery-powered cars are an alternative to the more familiar ones with exhaust
pipes. Although electric cars may seem like a new invention, those you can buy
today are the product of many years of testing ideas and making mistakes.
The first electric carriage was invented in the 1830s by Robert Anderson in
Scotland and many other inventors took inspiration from his idea. Eventually,
electric cars started to become more common in Europe and the United
States. In 1897, New York bought a lot of electric taxis that looked almost
identical to horse carriages, but without the horses. They each cost around
$50,000 (or £35,000) in today’s prices.

In the early 20th century, electric cars became even more popular as people
moved to bigger cities and wanted greater mobility within their city. Electric
cars were more comfortable, because unlike the petrol and diesel cars of the
time, they didn’t shake or release nasty smells. Unfortunately, in order to make
more money on these cars, their price was increased.

This price increase, along with the fact that people wanted to travel longer
distances, made petrol and diesel cars more popular. These cars were cheaper
and made it easier to travel between cities. By 1935, electric vehicles were
basically extinct.
